# APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.

#       To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
#       boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "[]"
#       replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include
#       the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate
#       comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a
#       file or class name and description of purpose be included on the
#       same "printed page" as the copyright notice for easier
#       identification within third-party archives.
