## 👩‍💻 About Me

Hi, I’m Airi — a computer science student and creative technologist who blends structured logic with playful curiosity. I build things that are both functional and thoughtful — from backend tools that streamline life, to interactive pages that carry personality.

Whether it's writing, engineering, or design, I believe in small details that make a big impact. This space is my way of sharing the experiments, side quests, and ideas I’ve brought to life.

Thanks for stopping by.
