Each window a story waiting to be told.
The city breathes in electric sighs,
Exhaling the hopes of a million souls.

Streets pulse with the rhythm of restless hearts,
Footsteps echoing against concrete and steel.
In this labyrinth of light and shadow,
We are all searching for something real.

The subway rumbles beneath our feet
Like the heartbeat of some sleeping giant,
Carrying strangers toward uncertain destinations,
Each journey a leap of faith.

Above, the stars compete with billboards
For our attention and our wonder,
But sometimes, in the space between
The bright lights and the darkness,

We catch a glimpse of who we truly areâ€”
Not lost in the crowd, but found
In the beautiful anonymity
Of being small beneath the vast sky.`,
