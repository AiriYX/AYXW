Falling behind your footsteps,
Inked within the pale snows.
Your scent fades the more I try to grasp.
Stranger, we never have met, but why does your name rings faintly familiar.
Our shared memories awaken in my mind.
The tunes unfold gently, their melancholy lingers in the silence of a blank stare.

Had I ever known you at all?
