Misty fog clouds all vision
Erasing all paths on sight

Time continues running as we keep chasing,
the gruesome reality of life approaches us at an exponential speed,
seconds turns into minutes,
days becomes years,
movements muffled into silence.

In the next instance we will be at the same spot,
pacing a different path.

Losing all the light in a flash
The blurred vision signifies a sign of hope,
Hope that one day we will wave away the mist.
Admist, above, and beyond
the chaos that consumes us.
